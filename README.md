# Cognitive-state-detection
Knowledge is created at an ever-increasing rate in today's information culture. To the context , the majority of us are constantly under pressure to absorb information and learn new things. However, gathering information and learning take time and mental energy. While ubiquitous computing devices such as cellphones enable us to consume information at any time and from any location, technologies are frequently disruptive rather than sensitive to the actual user context. Over the course of the day, people's attentiveness and cognitive capacity fluctuate. The main purpose of this project is to understand how human thought triggers cognitive action and demonstrate a methodology that simplified identification of user cognitive state using MediaPipe's open source framework and machine learning algorithm. The predictive model is lightweight and adaptable to smart devices and has high level of accuracy.
